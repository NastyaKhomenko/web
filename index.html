    <h2 align="center" >About singer</h2>
    <p class="container ">Ariana Grande is a sitcom-star-turned-pop music sensation, known for such hit songs as
        'Problem,' 'Bang Bang,'
        'Dangerous Woman' and 'Thank U, Next.'Ariana Grande was born in Boca Raton, Florida, in 1993 and began
        performing onstage when she was a child. Her involvement in a Broadway play at age 15, followed by some small TV
        parts, helped her land the role of Cat on TV's Victorious. She followed that with the spinoff Sam & Cat and then
        dove headfirst into a chart-topping musical career, releasing five albums: Yours Truly (2013), My Everything
        (2014), Dangerous Woman (2016), Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019). Her popularity has been fueled by a
        strong social media presence on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
    <h2 align="center" >Best album</h2>
    <p class="container ">'Bang Bang,' 'One Last Time'
        During the summer of 2014, Grande teamed up with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj on the single “Bang Bang,” a track
        that debuted at No. 6 and peaked at No. 3 in the United States. The album spawned another hit single “One Last
        Time,” which reached number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Grande had three hit singles from My Everything on
        the Billboard chart at the same time.<br>

        'Dangerous Woman'
        In 2015 Grande released Christmas & Chill, a holiday album, and the single "Focus," which debuted at number
        seven on the Billboard's Hot 100. In February 2016, she released her third album Dangerous Woman, and the title
        track debuted at number 10 on the Hot 100 that March. She made music history with the track's success, becoming
        the first artist to have the lead singles from her first three albums debut in the Top 10. Dangerous Woman,
        which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, also features collaborations with Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Macy
        Gray and Future.<br>

        'Sweetener'
        Grande returned to the charts in April 2018 with "No Tears Left to Cry," the catchy, upbeat response to the
        previous year's Manchester concert bombing. She followed in June with the dance track "The Light Is Coming,"
        featuring Minaj; dropped the sultry "God Is a Woman" in mid-July; and delivered "Breathin" in September. The
        four releases were included in her highly anticipated album Sweetener, which debuted in mid-August, as was a
        track about her whirlwind romance with Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson. The overall success of Sweetener
        led to her first Grammy win, for Best Pop Vocal Album, in February 2019.<br>
        'Thank U, Next'
        Grande quickly returned to the studio to produce her fifth album, Thank U, Next. The title track hit airwaves in
        early November 2018, and another chart-topper, "7 Rings," arrived in January 2019. The album debuted in February
        to strong praise, alongside a new single, "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored." Grande followed with a
        series of collaborations, including "Rule the World," with 2 Chainz, "Monopoly," with Victoria Monét, and
        "Boyfriend," with Social House.<br>

        In April 2019 the 25-year-old songstress demonstrated her drawing power by becoming the youngest performer ever
        to headline Coachella, as well as just the fourth woman to earn the honor.
