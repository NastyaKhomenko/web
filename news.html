                            singer Ariana Grande has sued Forever 21 for $10 million, accusing the clothing retailer of
                            trademark
                            infringement for stealing her name and likeness to promote its products and a beauty company

                            founders' daughters.

                            In a complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court on Monday, Grande accused Forever 21 and

                            likeness and music to confuse consumers into thinking she endorsed them.

                            she struggled
                            with anxiety during her stay in London. Answering a fan who asked her why she hadn't posted

                            LANA DEL REY COVERED ARIANA GRANDE'S 'BREAK UP WITH
                                YOUR GIRLFRIEND, I'M BORED' WITH WOOZY WHISPERS.
                            You've heard Ariana Grande's "Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored," but you've never
                            heard it quite
                            like this.

                            Lana Del Rey stopped by BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge and gave a spooky performance of Grande's
                            bold and sexily
                            selfish hit, grounding the buoyant track in a mysterious swamp that swallows all who enter
                            it. She performed
                            her Sublime cover "Doin' Time" also, but the "Break Up" cover is what shocks. It's almost
                            like it's an
                            entirely different song.
